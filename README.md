Social Networking Service Characteristics

    • The ability to connect individuals from all over the world, though some platforms recommend that individuals know one another in real life before connecting online.
    • They are free. Their business model is based on breadth of membership, therefore charging for use would be counterproductive. Still, the possibility remains that if a network grew large and useful enough, charging a fee may be possible.
    • They connect people with common histories, such as school attendance, work colleagues, or people who share a common interest.
    • They may help forge and develop relationships between people who share a profession or business network.
